This is what the BBCs Summer of Wildlife season is all about; through established favourites like BBC Twos Springwatch, and major new TV commissions, through radio, online and public events and with the help of many partners, we hope to raise awareness of the amazing richness and diversity of the UKs wildlife, and to encourage to find out more about it, whether its a rare butterfly or a common magpie. 

The season began with an idea from Natural History Unit in Bristol well over a year ago. As commissioner for BBC Learning, I looked for ways to support the ambition and with BBC One we have co-commissioned a major new series Britains Big Wildlife Revival that will start in August, and with Childrens a new live Saturday morning show Wild! just started on CBBC.
