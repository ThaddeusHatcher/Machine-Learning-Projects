Derek Mason did not need to be reminded.

He was well aware when the week started of Vanderbilt’s recent history against South Carolina and he made sure his players knew it as well.

“South Carolina has won nine straight, 16 of the last 18,” Mason said Tuesday. “But this will be a street fight.”

The Commodores’ last win in the series was in 2008. Their chance to end that streak comes Saturday when they host the Gamecocks (3 p.m., SEC Network) in their SEC opener.

  
Three reasons to believe Vanderbilt will win Saturday

• The coach’s son: Vanderbilt quarterback Kyle Shurmur is one of five SEC quarterbacks who has averaged better than 250 passing yards per game thus far in 2018. He is fifth at 251.3.5 yards and has five touchdown passes. A four-year starter, he is third on Vanderbilt’s career passing list. His father, Pat Shurmur, is a long-time NFL offensive coordinator who is in his first season as head coach of the New York Giants.

• Runners a’plenty: Four different running backs have scored a rushing touchdown this season and three — Ke’Shawn Vaughn, Khari Blasingame and Jamauri Wakefield — have between 100 and 200 rushing yards. All three average more than 4.6 yards per carry, which means the Commodores have no shortage of options when it comes to running the ball.

• Well-tested: Vanderbilt played a top 10 opponent (Notre Dame) last Saturday and had a chance to win in the fourth quarter. It ended as a 22-17 defeat but the Commodores proved they could make adjustments during the game and were the better team in the second half. That should set them up well in terms of their confidence against South Carolina, a team that was in the top 25 briefly earlier this season.

 
Three reasons to believe Vanderbilt will lose Saturday

• The coach’s son: South Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley is one of five SEC quarterbacks who has averaged better than 250 passing yards per game thus far in 2018. He is fourth at 259.5 yards and has five touchdown passes. A junior, he is second in career completion percentage at South Carolina. His father, Bobby Bentley, was a long-time high school coach and currently serves as South Carolina’s running backs coach.

• Runners a’plenty: Two of the 44 players who have rushed for at least 1,000 yards in a career at South Carolina are on the current roster. Juniors Rico Dowdle (1,138 yards) and A.J. Turner (1,055 yards) share the rushing duties with two other juniors, Ty’Son Williams and Mon Denson, which means the Gamecocks have no shortage of options when it comes to running the ball.

• Well rested: South Carolina has had two weeks to recover from a 41-17 loss to Georgia in its SEC opener on Sept. 8. Its matchup with Marshall, scheduled for last Saturday, was canceled due to concerns about Hurricane Florence. That means the Gamecocks should be at their best physically for their first road game of the season.

  
The bottom line

Vanderbilt players and coaches have said repeatedly this week that they have no interest in moral victories. Each of the last three years, they played well against South Carolina but they lost all three an average of 6.3 points. The worst of those defeats was by 10 points.

If the Commodores are going to start winning meaningful games instead of just coming close, this is the place to start.
