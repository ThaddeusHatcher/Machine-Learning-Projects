The Vanderbilt Commodores are enjoying a much-needed bye week. Here are the stat leaders for the Commodores through the bye week.
The Vanderbilt Commodores are in the middle of a much-needed bye week. The Commodores sit at 4-5 with three games left. The Commodores will have to end the year with a 2-1 record if they want to make it to a bowl game at the end of the year.

After the bye week, the Vanderbilt Commodores will travel to Missouri to take on a struggling Tigers team. Although they are struggling, Drew Lock will still be a threat to the Vanderbilt defense. This will be a huge game as the Commodores could have the chance to sit at 5-5 on the year and just win one of their last two games.

The Commodores will then have two home games to end the season off. They will host the Ole Miss Rebels the next week. The Rebels have a high potent offense but have a defense that has struggled all season long. It will be interesting to see what Derek Mason dials up in this game.

After that, the Vanderbilt Commodores will have their annual matchup against their rivals, the Tennessee Volunteers.  This matchup has the possibility of being a game that could send the winner to a bowl game and the loser home. The Commodores will have a chance to make it three straight against the Volunteers.

Much of the guys on this list arent surprising, as theyve been standout players for the Commodores all season long. With that, here are the stat leaders for the Vanderbilt Commodores through the first nine games.
