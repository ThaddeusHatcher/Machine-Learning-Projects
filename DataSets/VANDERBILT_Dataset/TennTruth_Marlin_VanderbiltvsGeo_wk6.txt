Will the Tennessee Volunteers be able to upset the No. 2 ranked Georgia Bulldogs this weekend? Here are our sitewide predictions for this SEC matchup.
The Tennessee football team will have yet another very tough matchup this Saturday, as they head down to Athens to take on the No. 2 team in the country, the Georgia Bulldogs.

The Bulldogs are very talented all around and will be a very tough team for the Volunteers to handle. They head into this game with a 4-0 record, while Tennessee has a 2-2 record currently.

Georgia is led by quarterback Jake Fromm. Fromm led them to a National Championship appearance in his true freshman year in Athens. The Bulldogs stick with a two running back system, as both Elijah Holyfield and D’Andre Swift share snaps for them.

Their defense, like always is relentless as well.

Vanderbilt has hit a rough patch in their season, as they have been losers of two straight games. They will look to get back on track this Saturday when they host in-state foe TSU.

TSU heads into this game with a 2-0 record after two of their first four games have been canceled.

Vanderbilt now has a record of 2-2 on the season, with wins coming against MTSU and Nevada and losses coming to Notre Dame and South Carolina. Vanderbilt should be able to get back to a winning record on the year before heading into a very tough stretch of the season against SEC foes.

This game will be a very tough game for the Tennessee Volunteers, as they are in the midst of their very tough five-game stretch. The Bulldogs will be too much for Tennessee to handle, as this game could get ugly.

The Volunteers shot themselves in the foot a ton last week and they won’t be able to do that this week as well, as Georgia will be able to capitalize on those mistakes. This one will likely be a blowout.
