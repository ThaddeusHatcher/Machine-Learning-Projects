Reasons to believe: Vanderbilt at Georgia
Commodores need their best performance of the season if they are to beat the country's No. 2 team

Derek Mason was quick to heap praise on Georgia during his weekly press briefing.

And why not? The Bulldogs (5-0, 3-0 in the SEC) are ranked No. 2 in the country, which is right where they ended last season. They have won 12 of their last 13 SEC regular-season contests, including three this season, and lead the conference in total defense.

"The Georgia Bulldogs are a well-oiled machine,” Mason said. “Kirby [Smart] is doing a terrific job of assembling talent. Those guys play extremely fast in all three phases."

Saturday’s contest (6:30 p.m., SEC Network) will be Georgia’s homecoming. It will be the 25th time the Commodores (3-2, 0-1) are the Bulldogs’ homecoming opponent and the UGA faithful were disappointed just four times in the first 24.

  
Three reasons to believe Vanderbilt will win Saturday

• It’s been done: The Commodores have had more success against Georgia in recent seasons than has been the norm. Under Mason, they won 17-16 in Athens two years ago. When James Franklin was coach, they won the 2013 matchup 31-27 in Nashville. That is two victories in the past five years. Yes, it is a modest measure of success but it suggests that an upset is possible.

• Up in the air: Vanderbilt is one of four SEC offenses that has completed 100 passes or more (only Missouri and Texas A&M have more completions) and one of six that averages better than 250 passing yards per game. It is not likely that unit will be able to string together long drives against a defense the caliber of Georgia’s, but if it can pick up chunks of yards through the air there is a chance to make things interesting.

• Cross the line: Ke’Shawn Vaughn (pictured) is one of six SEC running backs with at least five rushing touchdowns and — at his current pace has a chance to break Zac Stacy’s program of 14 in a season, set in 2011. If the Commodores are going to pull the upset, they won’t be able to settle for field goals. They will need touchdowns and Vaughn is the most likely candidate end drives that get close to the end zone.

  
Three reasons to believe Vanderbilt will lose Saturday

• It’s Georgia: Last year’s runner-up in the College Football Playoff looks very much like a national championship contender once again this season. The Bulldogs have won all five games by at least two touchdowns, has scored 40 or more four times and allowed 17 or fewer four times. Their early results include a 24-point victory over South Carolina, which beat Vanderbilt by 23.

• Well-grounded: The Bulldogs have run the ball 201 times, which is nearly twice as many as the number of pass attempts (114). Four running backs have more than 20 carries this season and al four average better than 4.5 yards per rush. As a team, Georgia averages 6.0 yards per rush. It’s not that the Bulldogs can’t throw the ball more. It’s that they don’t need to.

• Scoring options: In two-plus seasons under coach Kirby Smart, Georgia has scored 10 touchdowns on defense and special teams. This season already includes touchdowns on a fumble recovery, an interception return, a punt return and a blocked punt. Often, it’s not enough to just to stop Georgia’s offense, and Vanderbilt likely will have a hard enough time doing that.

  
The bottom line

A Vanderbilt victory would be a huge upset, not to mention the type of signature victory Mason and his staff desperately need. Since the start of the 2017 season the Commodores have pretty much won the games they should have and have lost the ones they should have — and haven’t been particularly close in the latter category.

Players and coaches have said they are not interested in moral victories, but it might be that the best they can hope for is not to get blown out in this one.
