The last time Vanderbilt went to Notre Dame, Vanderbilt came into the game on a three-game losing streak that would ultimately reach nine games when all was said and done; the Commodores lost that game 41-0 on their way to a 2-9 season.

At least one side of things hasnt changed. Notre Dame comes into todays game ranked in the top 10; the Irish in 1995 were ranked #24 at the time of the Vanderbilt game, thanks mostly to a season-opening loss to a Northwestern team that was lightly regarded at the time but ended that season in the Rose Bowl. Notre Dame would end 1995 9-3 and ranked 11th.

Vanderbilt, on the other hand, has already matched its 1995 win total in the first two weeks of the season: the Commodores are 2-0 coming off back-to-back drubbings of MTSU and Nevada. In the preseason, we looked at the Notre Dame game as a reality check after two teams that Vanderbilt should beat  but on the heels of the impressive performances and Notre Dames, ahem, turd against Ball State last week, we can believe, right? The Vegas line is 13.5, but S&P+ thinks the final score will be 24-20, Notre Dame.

Yeah, this is a game we can win. Yeah, were probably high while writing this. Have fun.
