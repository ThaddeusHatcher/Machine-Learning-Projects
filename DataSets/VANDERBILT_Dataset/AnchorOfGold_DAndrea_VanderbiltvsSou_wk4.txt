I was more impressed with the sudden aggression the team played with up front. Jason Tarver’s gameplan dialed up a ton of blitzes and kept Brent Stockstill backpedaling all evening. Not only did this force a ton of back-foot throws, but it also took the pressure from a safety unit that was missing two starters by the second quarter. I was particularly happy with the play we got from Louis Vecchio, who was a lottery ticket graduate transfer from Penn who is living proof the Ivy is ready for its spot in the FCS playoff.

Derek Mason loves platoons. And since he can’t realistically put one together at quarterback this year, he’ll rotate through the other position in the backfield instead. Besides, the Blasingame-Wakefield-Vaughn trio is different enough to fill whatever role the team needs. I’m a fan.

Reno gave us the music video for Eddie Money’s Take Me Home Tonight. The hell you leave it alone.
