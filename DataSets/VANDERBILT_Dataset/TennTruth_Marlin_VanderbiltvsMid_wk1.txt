The Vanderbilt Commodores begin their season on Saturday as they take on the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders. Here are our sitewide predictions for that game.

The Vanderbilt Commodores will begin their 2018 campaign on Saturday night at 7:30 CT, as they take on nearby Middle Tennessee State on the SEC Network. Both teams head into this game looking to start their year with a win. Last year, Vanderbilt headed to Murfreesboro to take on Middle Tennessee, where the Commodores were able to handle the Blue Raiders 35-8.

Stetson Marlin’s Prediction

This will be an interesting game for both Middle Tennessee and Vanderbilt. Both teams return their starting quarterbacks, so the outcome of the game will likely come from the quarterback that outperforms the other. Vanderbilt returns Kyle Shurmur, while MTSU returns Brent Stockstill. Vanderbilt will have to replace star running back Ralph Webb, but I think Vanderbilt’s defense will be too much in this game.
Vanderbilt 28 –  Middle Tennessee 17
