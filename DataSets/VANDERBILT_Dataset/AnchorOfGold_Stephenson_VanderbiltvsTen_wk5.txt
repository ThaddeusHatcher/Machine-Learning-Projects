Last year, after a positive start to the season, Vanderbilt ran into the buzzsaw that is Alabama and lost 59-0.
But the real deflating game arguably came a week later when the Commodores went to the Swamp and, after hanging around for most of the game, lost to the Florida Gators 38-24.
This year, instead of following a deflating loss with a road trip to play an SEC team, the Commodores will host Tennessee State instead. Tennessee State is 2-0 against the murderer’s row of Bethune-Cookman and Eastern Illinois; they’ve also had games against Jackson State and Hampton cancelled due to weather. This is a game to get right before... oh God, we go to Georgia next week?
Anyway, Vanderbilt should win. The question is by how much?

The halftime show will be a good contest, and Vanderbilt’s Spirit of Gold Marching Band is an underdog against Tennessee State’s Aristocrat of Bands. I really, really like the idea of scheduling nearby FCS teams instead of paying random teams from across the country to come to Nashville. Tennessee State will have a good showing.
The actual football game, though, should not be close, and if it is we can start having a different conversation about the season. The things of interest in this game are (a) whether Derek Mason starts using Ke’Shawn Vaughn more, and (b) whether, with the new redshirt rule, we get to see some true freshmen (including QB Allan Walters) take the field for the first time.
The Pick: Vanderbilt 35, Tennessee State 7.
The SEC Upset Pick of the Week: Well, if we were going off opening lines, I would take Kentucky over South Carolina — but that’s since moved to a pick ‘em (and Kentucky was favored briefly by the oddsmakers.) If not that, well... there aren’t really any games I like. I’ll go national and take Penn State over Ohio State, and I feel gross writing that sentence.
