The Tennessean sports staff disagreed on the winner of last season's Middle Tennessee-Vanderbilt game, but the Commodores are a consensus pick this time around.

Vanderbilt hosts MTSU at 6:30 p.m. Saturday (SEC Network Alternate) in the season opener. Here are the predictions from our sportswriters:

Vanderbilt 24, MTSU 21: One of the best regional games of Week One, this will be a nip-and-tuck battle. Vanderbilt will not dominate the line of scrimmage so easily like it did last season, but the Commodores will generate enough in the run game to pull it out. MTSU quarterback Brent Stockstill will play better than a year ago, and Vanderbilt wide receiver Kalija Lipscomb will have another big game against the Blue Raiders.
