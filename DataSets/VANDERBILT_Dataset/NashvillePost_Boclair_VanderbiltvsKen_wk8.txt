Reasons to believe: Vanderbilt at Kentucky
Commodores will have to do a better job of containing Wildcats running back Benny Snell this year

Vanderbilt’s quest for bowl eligibility has become a road show.

Halfway to the necessary six wins, the Commodores (3-4, 0-3 in the SEC) will play their next three on the road beginning Saturday at Kentucky (6:30 p.m., SEC Network). Their next home game is not until Nov. 17 and if they don’t get a win before then they will not be going to a bowl game this season.

"It's not really about the venue,” coach Derek Mason said. “It's about the opponent."

This week’s opponent is a good one. The Wildcats (5-1, 3-1) are ranked 14th and have two wins against teams that have beaten Vanderbilt handily, Florida and South Carolina.


Three reasons to believe Vanderbilt will win Saturday

• Top target: Wide receiver Kalija Lipscomb is one of two SEC players averaging at least seven receptions per game and he is second in the conference with six touchdown catches. He already has set a career-high with 49 receptions this season. Quarterback Kyle Shurmur never has had such a reliable target and when he is good, the Commodores are good. Every win this season has included a Lipscomb touchdown catch.

• Getting started: After falling behind early in many games this season, Vanderbilt has scored in the first quarter of each of its last two. Last week, the Commodores led Florida 7-3 at the start of the second and 21-3 during the second. Kentucky is last in the SEC in passing offense and if Vanderbilt jumps out to a lead this time, the Wildcats might not be equipped to recover.

• Cross the line: Kentucky has the fewest red zone touchdowns in the SEC (12) and is the only team in the conference that has not thrown a touchdown pass while in the red zone. Vanderbilt’s defense has forced three red zone turnovers (second in the conference to Ole Miss). If the Commodores don’t big plays and force the Wildcats to drive the length of the field, they might eventually dig in their heels and keep the points from piling up.


Three reasons to believe Vanderbilt will lose Saturday

• Benny the Jet: Benny Snell (pictured) is the SEC’s rushing leader with an average of 116.5 yards per game and has 3,123 career rushing yards in 30 games. He is just the fifth SEC player since 2000 to top 3,000 rushing yards in his first 30 games. In last year’s meeting, UK rushed for 232 yards, including 116 and three touchdowns from Snell, who had just 17 attempts.

• Move the chains: Vanderbilt has the SEC’s worst third-down defense. Opponents have converted 46.5 percent of the time and conference opponents have converted more than half of their chances. Kentucky has the fewest third-down plays of any SEC team (72) because it moves the ball well on first and second down. When it does get to third down in this one, there is a good chance it will convert.

• Conference struggles: The Commodores have lost 10 of 11 SEC games since the start of last season. In each of those defeats, they have allowed 34 points or more, including 44 to Kentucky in the last meeting. Gone are the days when Vanderbilt had no chance against most conference competition. But right now, this program just doesn’t measure up on most Saturdays.


The bottom line

Kentucky has made the type of leap this year that Vanderbilt has sought for some time. It snapped a long losing streak against Florida and has established itself as a legitimate top 25 team. It will take something remarkable for the Commodores to win this game, particularly since it is on the road.
