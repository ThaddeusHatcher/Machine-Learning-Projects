Tennessee State football player Christion Abercombie remains in critical condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he underwent emergency surgery Saturday during the Tigers’ game against Vanderbilt.

Abercrombie, a transfer from Illinois, sustained a head injury late in the second quarter. He walked to the sideline and soon after collapsed. At that point, he was taken from the field on a stretcher and rushed to the hospital.

“My thoughts and prayers are with Christion and his family,” coach Rod Reed (pictured) said in a release from the TSU athletics department Sunday evening. “He’s fighting, and we just need to keep him uplifted with prayers.”

Abercrombie, TSU’s starting middle linebacker, made five tackles and was credited with one quarterback pressure before he was hurt late in the first half. The Tigers lost 31-27.

Reed said he received messages of support from nearly every other Ohio Valley Conference head coach. Immediately after the game, Vanderbilt’s Derek Mason expressed his concern and players from both teams prayed together on the field.

Abercrombie, a third-year sophomore, is tied for second on the team with 18 tackles through three games. He also has one and a half sacks.

An Atlanta native, he redshirted as a true freshman at Illinois and played in 11 games in 2017. He was a three-star prospect at Westlake High School who was ranked among the country’s top 100 linebackers.

“Christion is resting,” Staci Abercrombie, Christion’s mother, said. “He’s fighting. We’re trusting God and please continue to pray.”
