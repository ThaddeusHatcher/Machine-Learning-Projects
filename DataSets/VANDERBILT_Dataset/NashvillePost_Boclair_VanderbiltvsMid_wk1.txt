Rick Stockstill felt that his offensive line got schooled a year ago against Vanderbilt.

Now Middle Tennessee State’s blockers get a chance to show what they learned.

Three of the five starters up front in last season’s opener, a 28-6 defeat, get another try at the Commodores when MTSU kicks off 2018 at Vanderbilt on Saturday (6:30 p.m., SEC Network-alternate). Blue Raiders quarterback Brent Stockstill was sacked five times and no running back gained more than 26 yards in that 2017 contest.

“They got us last year, and the big difference was their front seven dominating our guys up front,” Rick Stockstill said. “We couldn't establish the run, had a hard time with protection, and it's an area that we need to improve on this year.”

MTSU added five offensive linemen, including two junior college transfers, during last December’s early signing period. A sixth joined the program during the second signing period in February.

Yet the starting five this week will bear a significant resemblance to the unit that got pushed around last year. Three starters from that game, left tackle Carlos Johnson, left guard Robert Behanan and right guard Chandler Brewer, a three-year starter, all are ready to give it another go. Behanan, though, was the center in 2017.

Right tackle Amir Luckett is likely the only member of the 2018 signing class who is likely to open this season as the starter.

All five are seniors or juniors.

"You never know until you get there,” Stockstill said. “We'll have three of the five starting linemen in that game last year start this week. I think all three of those guys are better than they were last year. The new guys coming in are going to play. I've got a lot more confidence in our offensive line.

“… We're a more experienced offensive line than where we were last year at this time. I like their toughness. You never know until you get out there to play, but I feel a lot better about where we are at this year."
