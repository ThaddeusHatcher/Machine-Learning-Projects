One Reason Why Tennessee State Will Win
The Tiger offense has been outstanding over the first two games, with former Minnesota Gopher Demry Croft and Michael Hughes combining so far for 337 passing yards per game on the sixth-ranked offense in the FCS.

Great at moving the chains, and with a defense that’s strong against the run and good at getting off the field. Vanderbilt is doing a whole lot of positive things offensively, but converting on third downs isn’t one of them.

It’s ben a struggle to establish the running game – failing to hit the 100-yard mark in the last two games. With Georgia up next, this is the week Vandy has to figure it out.

One Reason Why Vanderbilt Will Win
Takeaways. Vanderbilt gets them, Tennessee State doesn’t.

To pull this off, the Tigers have to be a +3 in turnover margin, and that’s not going to happen. They have just one turnover in the first two games, and turnovers have been a wee bit of an issue for the Commodores, but the D has nine takeaways in the first four games.

Yes, Vandy has to start running early on to try getting it going, but there won’t be a problem pushing the passing game against the shaky Tennessee State secondary. After a rough day against South Carolina, Shurmur will come up with a sharp day …

What’s Going To Happen
And the running game will work, too.

Tennessee State will be annoyingly pesky for a half – Vanderbilt will have to try. And then the Commodore offense will wake up in time to put the game away with a two third quarter scoring drives.

This won’t be your typical SEC vs. FCS blowout, but it’ll be a bit too entertaining … for a while.
